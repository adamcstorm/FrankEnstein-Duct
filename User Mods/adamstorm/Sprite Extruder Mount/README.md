The Creality Sprite Extruder is a common upgrade/stock option that many Ender users have. While there are better extruders out there, it is a capable extruder. Just a little heavy. I don' t judge ;-) 

In the interest of working with what you have, I created this mount. The Sprite extruder was the first upgrade I made on my Ender, but I quickly found that I wanted to upgrade the part cooling capability. Frank fit the bill but didn't support my only DD extruder at the time. 

STL is oriented for proper printing, no supports needed. CAD is included for your remixing pleasure.
